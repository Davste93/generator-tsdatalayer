##Pluralize or singularize nouns in your Node.js projects

Adapted from Natural by chrisumbel

Installation
------------

If you're just looking to consume tense without your own node application
please install the NPM

    npm install tense
    
If you're interested in contributing to tense or just hacking it then by all
means fork away!


Test
----------

    npm test
    
    
Use
----------

### Pluralization

    var Tense = require('tense');
    var tense = new Tense();
    
to pluralize a word (outputs "radii")

    console.log(tense.pluralize('radius'));

to singularize a word (outputs "beer")

    console.log(tense.singularize('beers'));

Like many of the other features String can be patched to perform the operations
directly. The "Noun" suffix to the methods is necessary as verbs may be
supported in the future.

    tense.attach();
    console.log('radius'.pluralizeNoun());
    console.log('beers'.singularizeNoun());
